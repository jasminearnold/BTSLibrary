                  BANGTAN SONYEONDAN aka BTS is a South Korean boy band formed in
                  2010. The band consists of Jin, RM, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, V, and
                  Jungkook. The members, as they are known, are talented musicians
                  and avid readers. The group became famous not only for their
                  musical hits but also through the documentation of their journey
                  from being idol trainees to k-pop performers. The group’s fans
                  are called ARMY. BTS consistently shares their lives to ARMY
                  through live streaming on the Weverse and Vlive App as well as
                  posting videos on Youtube. The group has attributed their huge
                  success to the support of ARMY. Through these livestream and
                  video posts, BTS not only shares the process of making music,
                  but also their everyday lives such as rehearsals and downtime
                  reading books.
